# GameGame
My first gaming project -- A 2D top down space shooter game.

To be an extremely simple game with minimal features since it's my first game. Will only have one ship, which few friendly NPC's in one corner a and a bunch of bad guys on the other corner with a few asteroids scattered here and there. Will have a simple GUI, a couple of weapon fire modes and heat seeking missiles. Maybe a small shape station with defensive turrets. Will be adding more features as I learn more. But I will stop at one point till I gain some development experience and start working on the 3D version.
